# Custom Apps

This file lists some of the customizations of apps found on the internet. Often these emerged from answering developers' questions.
The list serves as an additional way to find customizations again, besides the general [catalog](https://catalog.botengine.org).
If you think a change should be merged into the main branch, you can post on the [forum](https://forum.botengine.org) or create an issue on the [bots GitHub page](https://github.com/Viir/bots/issues).
If a majority of users choose to apply a change to an app, that change is more likely to be merged into the main branch. You can see the popularity displayed at `Total running time in hours` on the apps catalog entry.
To find an app on the catalog, you can also enter the commit as a search term, or use the `botengine  describe` command.
